Welcome to my personal page!
=======

I'm a Ph.D. *student* at  the [Community Ecology and Biogeography Lab](http://jeanphilippelessard.com/) (a.k.a. LessardLab) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) located in Montreal-Canada. In addition, I have a M.Sc. in Ecology and Evolution from the [University of Amsterdam (UvA)](https://www.uva.nl/en) where I worked with the [Biogeography and Macroecology research group (BIOMAC)](https://www.biomac.org/) in the Netherlands. I cursed my BSc. in Biology along with a *minor* in Environmental management at [Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ)](https://www.usfq.edu.ec/Paginas/Inicio.aspx) in Ecuador.

Born and raised in Ecuador, I grew up experiencing a great variety of landscapes and encountering many different living organisms. Such life experiences fostered a curiosity which pushed me to study biodiversity as a science.  With this in mind, my academic goal is to understand the fundamental patterns and mechanisms contributing to biodiversity formation and maintenance.  Sadly, I have also experienced close hand how climate change, human alterations, and un-oriented management have become a risk towards biodiversity. Thus, I also search to play a leading role to lay out the scientific masonry needed for the development of local and global biodiversity conservation efforts.

Currently, I am interested in the mechanisms of assembly of communities and the interactions between species at multiple trophic levels. More specifically, I am interested in the biogeography of those multi-species interactions and how individual pair-wise interactions assemble into multi-trophic networks to form of particular structural-topological patterns across different spatio-temporal scales. Finally, I'm also interested in the use of computational tools to mine biodiversity information from literature (e.g. species interactions / species traits) in order to contribute towards global efforts of biodiversity data mobilization.
