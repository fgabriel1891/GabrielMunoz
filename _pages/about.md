Welcome to my personal page!
=======

I'm a Ph.D. student in Biological Sciences working with the Community Ecology and Biogeography Lab at Concordia University in Montreal-Canada (PI: J.P. Lessard ). I also have a M.Sc. in Ecology and Evolution from the University of Amsterdam (UvA) in The Netherlands where I worked with the Biogeography and Macroecology research group (BIOMAC). I did my B.Sc. in Biology with a minor in Environmental management at San Francisco University of Quito (USFQ) in Ecuador.

Born and raised in Ecuador, I grew up experiencing a great variety of landscapes and encountering many living organisms. Such life experiences fostered a curiosity which pushed me to study biodiversity as a science. Sadly, I have also experienced close hand how climate change, human alterations, and un-oriented management have become a risk towards biodiversity. With this in mind, my academic goal is to understand the fundamental patterns and mechanisms contributing to biodiversity formation and maintenance. Thus, playing a role in the scientific masonry needed for the development of local and global biodiversity conservation efforts.

Currently, I am interested in the study of interactions between species at multiple trophic levels. More specifically, I am interested in the biogeography of those multi-species interactions and how individual pair-wise interactions assemble into multi-trophic networks to form of particular structural-topological patterns across different spatio-temporal scales. Finally, I'm also interested in the use of computational tools to mine biodiversity information from literature (e.g. species interactions / species traits) in order to contribute towards global efforts of biodiversity data mobilization.
